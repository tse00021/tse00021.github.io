        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <P>Hi, I'm <strong>Elvis</strong>. My birthday is on Septemper 7<sup>th</sup>. I enjoy outdoor activities,
            especially biking, hiking, swimming, and
            diving. They make me feel alive and connected to nature. Lately, I've been interested in
            learning how to snowboard. It looks really fun and exciting, and I'd love to give it a try.</P>

        <p>I really enjoy taking photos and videos. It brings me happiness to capture special moments and express my
            creativity through visuals. Being able to freeze time and convey emotions through pictures and videos brings
            me a lot of joy and fulfillment. I hope to find a <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> job that
            allows me to enjoy my passion."</p>
